PvPLevels is a plugin that implements a level system for PvP(Plus basic stats). This plugin saves the number of kills and deaths of each player. When a player reaches one of the kill amounts defined in config.yml, the player will reach that level and the configured commands, if you have added any, will be run. All stats, including Kills, Deaths, KDR, and Level can be seen with the command /pvpstats. You can see the stats of another online player with /pvpstats [playername].
